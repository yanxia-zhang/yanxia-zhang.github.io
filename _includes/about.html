  <h2><span>Bio</span></h2>
  <p>
    I am a research scientist at FX Palo Alto Laboratory (FXPAL). My current research focuses on human behavior sensing and analysis. Prior to my position at FXPAL, I was a post-doc researcher in the <a href="http://prb.tudelft.nl/">Pattern Recognition &amp; Bioinformatics Group</a> in TU Delft. I was a research fellow at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden, in the <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/csc/forskning/cvap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Vision and Active Perception Lab (CVAP)</a>, where I investigated natural human-robot interaction and social robotics.

    I received my PhD degree in Computer Science from Lancaster University in 2015, where I was also a Marie Curie research fellow. While in Lancaster, I investigated novel video-based gaze estimation techniques, gaze-based interaction for large displays, and using eye tracking for detecting dementia and health monitoring. I obtained my Master&#8217;s degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam, where I was awarded the Huygens Scholarship.

  <h2><span>Research Services</span></h2>
  <p>
    I served as the Paper &amp; Proceedings chair for the 5th ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction (SUI 2017). Previously, I co-organised the 5th International Workshop on Pervasive Eye Tracking and Mobile Eye-Based Interaction (sponsored by 3 industry partners) with academics from ETH Zurich and Max-Planck Institute for Informatics in 2015. I served on the program committee for the 3rd and the 6th International Workshop on Pervasive Eye Tracking and Mobile Eye-Based Interaction. I served on the program committee of the IEEE conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG) from 2017 to 2019. Frequently, I get invited to review submissions for international conferences (e.g., CHI, UIST, UbiComp, HRI, MobileHCI), Journals (e.g., Sensors, PMC, IJHCS, IMWUT, TMC, PLOS One) and magazines.
